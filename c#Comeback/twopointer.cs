// We are given two strings P and Q,
// each consisting of N lowercase English letters.
// For each position in the strings, we have to choose one letter from either P or Q, 
// in order to construct a new string S, such that the number of distinct letters in
// S is minimal. Our task is to find the number of distinct letters in 
// the resulting string S. For example, if P = "ca" and Q = "ab", 
// S can be equal to: "ca", "cb", "aa" or "ab". String "aa" 
// has only one distinct letter ('a'), so the answer is 1 (which is minimal among those strings).
// Write a function: class Solution { public int solution(string P, string Q); } 
// that, given two strings P and Q, both of length N, returns the minimum number of distinct letters of a string S, 
// that can be constructed from P and Q as described above. **Examples:** 1. Given P = "abc", Q = "bcd", your function should return 2.
// All possible strings S that can be constructed are: "abc", "abd", "acc", "acd", "bbc", "bbd", "bcc", "bcd". 
// The minimum number of distinct letters is 2, which be obtained by constructing the following strings: "acc", "bbc", "bbd", "bcc". 2.
// Given P = "axxz", Q = "yzwy", your function should return 2. String S must consist of at least two distinct letters in this case. 
// We can construct S = "yxxy", where the number of distinct letters is equal to 2, and this is the only optimal solution. 3.
// Given P = "bacad", Q = "abada", your function should return 1. We can choose the letter 'a' in each position, so S can be equal to "aaaaa". 4. 
// Given P = "amz", Q = "amz", your function should return 3. The input strings are identical, so the only possible S that can be constructed is "amz",
// and its number of distinct letters is 3. Write an **efficient** algorithm for the following assumptions: 
// * N is an integer within the range [1..200,000]; * strings P and Q are both of length N; * strings P and Q are made only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z);
//  * strings P and Q contain a total of at most 20 distinct letters
